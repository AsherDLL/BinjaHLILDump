# Binary Ninja HLIL Dump

## Description

This is a Binary Ninja plugin written in Python that allows you to decompile the whole binary,
and then dump all that in a directory. There are some scenarios where this might be helpful,
for example:

* Using your favorite text editor (such as Sublime) to read/find code.
* Being able to `diff -u` source.
* etc.
